# Gadgets Additions

**Desktop monitoring inspired by the AddGadgets.com (and Orbmu2k) Windows Sidebar Gadgets.**

This suite was created as addition to [SilverAzide's suite](https://github.com/SilverAzide/Gadgets) to complete the move of our beloved Addgadgets.com collection from Windows Sidebar-Gadgets to Rainmeter.
Since many things like power control or volume control were never covered by Addgadgets, Orbmu2k's gadgets were a great addition at the time, so some gadgets were also redone for the suite.
Over time many more gadgets have been added which none of them ever had.
